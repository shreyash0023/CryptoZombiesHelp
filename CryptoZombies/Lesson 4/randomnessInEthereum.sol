/*
	In Ethereum, when you call a function on a contract, you broadcast it to a node or nodes on the network as a transaction
	
	The nodes on the network then collect a bunch of transactions, try to be the first to solve a computationally-intensive mathematical problem as a "Proof of Work", and then publish that group of transactions along with their Proof of Work (PoW) as a block to the rest of the network.

	Once a node has solved the PoW, the other nodes stop trying to solve the PoW, verify that the other node's list of transactions are valid, and then accept the block and move on to trying to solve the next block.
*/

// This makes our random number function exploitable.


Generate a random number between 1 and 100:
uint randNonce = 0;
uint random = uint(keccak256(now, msg.sender, randNonce)) % 100;
randNonce++;
uint random2 = uint(keccak256(now, msg.sender, randNonce)) % 100;

/*
	Let's say we had a coin flip contract â€” heads you double your money, tails you lose everything. Let's say it used the above random function to determine heads or tails. (random >= 50 is heads, random < 50 is tails).

	If I were running a node, I could publish a transaction only to my own node and not share it. I could then run the coin flip function to see if I won â€” and if I lost, choose not to include that transaction in the next block I'm solving. I could keep doing this indefinitely until I finally won the coin flip and solved the next block, and profit.
